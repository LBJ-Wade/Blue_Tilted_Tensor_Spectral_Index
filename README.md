# Blue_Shifted_Tensor_Spectral_Index
This Mathematica code was devised in order to study the effect of a Chern-Simons term in the case of a Canonical scalar field during the inflationary era. 
As a toy model, we study chaotic inflation, meaning a quadratic scalar potential and as a Chern-Simons scalar coupling function, a trigonometric model was chosen. 
This particular model was fine tuned such that the tensor spectral index obtains a positive value. It is quite flexible and other models can also be studied relatively easy.
Solutions of the scalar field emerge naturally so the user needs only to change which root wants to choose as a solution, and in consequence the free parameters of the model used.
The only approximations imposed are the slow-roll conditions which one can ascertain their validity after calculations have been carried out. The code is available for distribution.
